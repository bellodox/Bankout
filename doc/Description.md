# 🎲 Bankout — The High-Stakes Card Game of Risk and Reward  

Bankout is a push-your-luck card game where every draw feels like a gamble and every decision could swing the match. It’s poker‑tense, blackjack‑sharp, and just chaotic enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.  

At its heart, Bankout asks one question: **Do you keep drawing for more, or do you bank what you’ve got before it all goes bust?**

## 🏦 The Core Loop  

- **Numbers (2–10):** These are your bread and butter. Each one adds to your **Loot** — your unbanked stash.  
- **Banking:** At any time, you can lock in Loot to your **Bank**. That’s your permanent score. But if you bust before banking, Loot vanishes.  
- **The Danger Cards:**  
  - **Jacks** put you on **Alert**. Three in one turn? Bust.  
  - **Aces** are harmless off‑alert, but deadly if you’re already on Alert. Draw one then, and you’re done.  
- **The Power Cards:**  
  - **Queens** bail you out — they cancel a Jack and even disarm a lurking Ace.  
  - **Kings** are the jackpot — double your Loot and bank it instantly, but your turn ends.  
  - **Jokers** (in later rounds) are wild chaos: they can swap Banks, mimic Queens or Kings, or be countered in a tense standoff.  

Every turn is a dance between greed and caution. Do you risk another draw, or do you bank and pass the pressure to your opponent?

## ⚡ Two Ways to Play  

### **Bankout Mode**  
- Classic format.  
- First to **$1,000 Bank** wins the round.  
- Best-of-three rounds decides the match.  
- Think of it as a race — you’re sprinting for the finish line, but tripping over a Jack or Ace can cost you everything.  

### **Blitz Mode**  
- Sudden death intensity.  
- Three rounds, cumulative scoring. 
- When the deck runs out, the round ends. 
- Highest total after Round 3 wins.  
- If tied, you go into **Sudden Death** with a stripped-down deck (Numbers + Jacks only).  
- Blitz is about scoreboard management: sometimes you play safe to protect a lead, sometimes you go all-in to catch up.

## 🃏 Jokers ON vs. OFF  

- **Jokers OFF:** Pure probability. It’s all about counting cards, calculating risk, and playing clean.  
- **Jokers ON:** Chaos enters the room.  
  - **Round 2:** A single Joker lurks in the deck. If your opponent has no Bank, it goes wild — doubling your Loot or saving you from danger. If they do, it swaps Banks.  
  - **Round 3:** Two Jokers, and now they can be **countered**. Play one to swap, your opponent can throw theirs to cancel. Both are discarded, and your turn ends.  
  - This creates bluffing, timing wars, and brutal reversals.

## 🎯 How to Play Smart  

- **Know your thresholds:**  
  - If your Loot is small, keep drawing — the risk is worth it.  
  - Once your Loot climbs, calculate: is the expected gain of another draw worth the bust risk?  
  - With a King in hand, snap‑bank when your Loot is near the “double threshold.”  

- **Queens are lifelines:**  
  - Don’t hoard them forever. Sometimes playing a Queen proactively to clear Alert is smarter than waiting for disaster.  

- **Jokers are tempo weapons:**  
  - Ahead? Bank smaller chunks so swaps hurt less.  
  - Behind? Stretch your runs, hunt for Joker swings, and embrace variance.  

- **In Blitz:**  
  - Round 1 sets the tone.  
  - Round 2 is where you catch up or extend.  
  - Round 3 is all about protecting or overturning the scoreboard.

## 🔥 Why It Works  

Bankout is elegant because it layers **simple rules** with **deep timing decisions**:  
- Every card has a clear role, but their interactions create rich strategy.  
- The game flexes between **mathy precision** (Jokers OFF) and **chaotic drama** (Jokers ON).  
- It rewards both **probability discipline** and **psychological play**.

## 🏆 For Teachers, Judges, and Trainers  

- **Teaching tip:** Start with Numbers, Jacks, and Aces. Add Queens, then Kings, then Jokers. Players will “get it” in under 10 minutes.  
- **Judging tip:** Remember the timing order: reveal → bust checks → latent trigger → card effect → hand limit → end checks. This resolves 90% of disputes.  
- **Training drill:** Give players scenarios (Loot = 80, Alert = true, 2 Queens in hand, 30 cards left). Ask: draw, bank, or King?

## ✨ The Experience  

Bankout feels like blackjack with teeth, poker with hidden daggers, and Uno with a mean streak. One moment you’re cruising with $900 Bank, the next a Joker swap flips the game. Or you’re behind, but a Queen‑covered run and a King slam vault you to victory.  

It’s not just about luck — it’s about knowing when to push, when to pull back, and when to weaponize chaos.
