# 🏦 Bankout Cheat Sheet

## 🎯 Goal
- **Bankout Mode:** First to **$1,000 Bank** wins the round. Best of 3 rounds = match.
- **Blitz Mode:** 3 rounds, add up Banks. If deck runs out, the round ends. Highest total wins. Tie → Sudden Death (Numbers + Jacks only).

## 🃏 Card Effects

| Card | Effect | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **2–10** | Add value to **Temp** | Safe money |
| **Jack (J)** | +1 Jack this turn; Alert = ON | 3rd Jack = Bust |
| **Ace (A)** | If Alert → Bust; else Latent +1 | Latent triggers on next Jack |
| **Queen (Q)** | -1 Jack; -1 Latent; clear Alert if Jacks=0 | Does **not** end turn |
| **King (K)** | Bank 2×Temp; reset states | Ends turn |
| **Joker (X)** | **R1:** none<br>**R2:** immediate on draw<br>**R3:** to hand; swap/wild; can be countered | Swap if opp >0 Bank; Wild = Queen/King if opp = 0 |

## ⚠️ Bust Conditions
- 3rd Jack in one turn  
- Ace drawn while Alert = true  
- Latent Ace triggered by Jack with no Queen  

**Bust = lose Temp, keep Bank, reset turn.**

---

## ✋ Hand Rules
- Only Q, K, X go to hand
- Max 2 cards
- If >2, choose discards immediately

---

## 🔄 Turn Flow
1. Reset Temp, Alert, Jacks, Latent  
2. On your turn: **Draw / Play / Bank / End**  
3. Resolve draw in order:  
   - Reveal → Bust checks → Latent trigger → Card effect → Hand limit → End checks

## 🎲 Jokers ON vs. OFF
- **OFF:** Pure probability, precise play.  
- **ON:** Chaos & swing.  
  - **R2:** 1 Joker, immediate.  
  - **R3:** 2 Jokers, to hand, Counter Joker live.  

---

## 🧮 Risk Math (Quick)
- Avg Number ≈ $6  
- Bust risk ≈ (Aces left / deck) + (if 2 Jacks already, Jacks left / deck)  
- **Draw if:** Temp < ((1 − p_bust)/p_bust) × 6  
- **Snap King if:** Temp ≥ 6 / p_bust  

---

## 🎯 Smart Play Tips
- **Queens:** Don’t hoard — use to clear Alert proactively.  
- **Kings:** Fire when Temp is near snap threshold.  
- **Jokers:**  
  - Ahead → bank smaller, deny swap value.  
  - Behind → stretch runs, hunt Joker swings.  
- **Blitz:**  
  - Round 1 = setup.  
  - Round 2 = catch up or extend.  
  - Round 3 = protect or overturn scoreboard.

## 🏆 Judge/Trainer Reminders
- Auto‑Queen on latent Jack is **mandatory** if available.  
- Counter Joker (R3): discard to cancel swap; both Jokers out; opponent’s turn ends.  
- Hand limit = 2, enforce immediately.
- Priority: Reveal → Bust checks → Latent → Effect → Hand limit → End checks.
